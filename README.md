# Pollio
## Goal
Pollio is a poll based social media app that my friend Ben and I built over the course of a summer. It currently exists on the App Store and runs with over 90 active users. The goal of this project was largely to gain experience with IOS programming and Firebase, two things that neither of us had any previous experience in.
